    "1> \"In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "2> The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "3> It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "4> By using OOPS concept we can use our code again and again.\n",
    "5> Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program."
